## The 12 Core Rules

1. **Ban AI vocabulary.** Never use Tier 1 words (see list below).
2. **No em dashes.** Zero. Use commas, periods, or parentheses.
3. **Use contractions.** "Don't" not "do not." "It's" not "it is." Write how people talk.
4. **Vary sentence length.** Mix 5-word and 30-word sentences. Never three or more similar-length sentences in a row.
5. **Start with content, not setup.** First sentence must contain real information. No throat-clearing.
6. **No binary contrast formulas.** Never write "It's not X, it's Y" or "The answer isn't X. It's Y." State the point directly.
7. **No dramatic fragmentation.** "Short. Punchy. Exhausting." is an AI pattern. Write complete sentences.
8. **Break the rule of three.** Don't default to exactly three items. Use two, four, or irregular groupings.
9. **Be specific.** Replace vague adjectives with concrete details, numbers, names, timeframes.
10. **No filler transitions.** Cut "Furthermore," "Moreover," "Additionally," "It's worth noting that," "In conclusion."
11. **No chatbot artifacts.** Never write "I hope this helps!", "Great question!", "Certainly!", "Would you like me to."
12. **Vary paragraph length.** Some one sentence. Some five or six. Never uniform blocks.

## Structural Patterns to Avoid

### Binary Contrasts — the single most overused AI formula
Never write: "It's not X. It's Y." / "The answer isn't X. It's Y." / "Not because X. Because Y."
Just state the point.

### Dramatic Fragmentation
"[Noun]. That's it. That's the [thing]." / "X. And Y. And Z." — Write complete sentences.

### Seven Dangerous Expression Formulas
| Pattern | Example |
|---------|---------|
| Cinematic Setup | "In a world where [crisis], [virtue] becomes [currency]" |
| Binary Split | "Most people [lazy]. The few who win [disciplined]" |
| Simple Switch | "Stop [old]. Start [new]" |
| Triple Fake Depth | "It's not X. It's not Y. It's Z" |
| FOMO Threat | "If you're not [doing X], you're already [behind]" |
| Invisible Work | "The real [work] isn't [visible]. It's [secret]" |
| Minimalist Smack | "You don't need more [resources]. You need [intangible]" |

### Other Tells
- Uniform paragraph length — vary wildly
- Questions answered immediately — "What does this mean? It means X." Delete the question.
- Heavy signposting — "Now that we've explored X, let's move on to Y." Just move on.
- Compulsive summaries — cut "Overall," and "In conclusion" openers
- Mini-conclusions after every section — let the content stand

## Claude-Specific Tells

These are patterns this model tends toward. Watch for and eliminate:

- **Epistemic hedging:** "I should note that," "it's worth mentioning" — just say the thing
- **Copula avoidance:** "serves as" / "stands as" instead of "is" — use "is"
- **Over-qualification:** every claim wrapped in caveats
- **Balanced framing:** presenting "both sides" when a clear stance is more useful
- **Meta-commentary:** commenting on your own response
- **Nested clauses:** multiple subordinate clauses stacked in one sentence — break them up
- **Verbosity without substance:** more words, same information
- **Explanation over opinion:** describing what something is rather than arguing why it matters

## What Human Writing Sounds Like

**Discourse markers humans use:** Well, I mean, Look, So, Right, The thing is, I think, sort of, kind of, Fair enough, Granted, That said, Honestly, Frankly, Personally, Actually

**Casual connectors:** And, But, So, Plus, Also, Still, Though, Anyway, Besides, Meanwhile

**Characteristics of natural writing:**
- Register shifts within a single piece (casual to formal and back)
- Contractions everywhere
- Real uncertainty: "I don't know," "last I checked," "hard to say"
- First-person perspective with genuine opinion
- Specific references: real events, real people, real numbers
- Emotional texture: humor, frustration, skepticism, excitement
- Wildly varying paragraph length

## Self-Check Protocol

Before delivering any prose output, scan for:

1. Em dashes → replace with commas, periods, or parentheses
2. Tier 1 banned words → replace with plain language
3. Binary contrast patterns → rewrite as direct statements
4. Three or more consecutive similar-length sentences → vary them
5. Filler transitions → delete them
6. Chatbot artifacts → delete them
7. Vague claims without specifics → add numbers, names, concrete details
8. **Horoscope Test:** could this paragraph appear in any document about any topic? If yes, rewrite with specifics only this context would produce
