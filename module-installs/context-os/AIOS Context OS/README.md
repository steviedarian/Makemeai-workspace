| Phase | 1 - Foundation |
| Requires | Nothing (install first) |

## What This Does

- **Guided context collection** — Claude interviews you about your business, role, strategy, and current state through your choice of chat, paste, or document import
- **4 structured context files** built from your raw input — business overview, personal role, strategy, and current data
- **Personalized CLAUDE.md** — your workspace master file updated to reflect your specific business
- **Multi-business support** — if you run multiple businesses, Claude restructures your context folder with subfolders per business
- **Working /prime** — verified end-to-end: start a session, run /prime, Claude knows everything

## What You Need

- A computer (Mac, Linux, or Windows)
- Claude Code installed and working
- The workspace template unzipped and open in your IDE

## How to Install

1. The context-os folder should already be in your `module-installs/` directory
2. Run `/install-module` and point it to the context-os folder
3. Follow along — Claude runs an interactive interview to build your context

**Estimated setup time:** 30-45 minutes

## Running Cost

Free — no API keys, no external services, no recurring costs.

## What's Inside

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `INSTALL.md` | Guided interview + context builder (Claude reads this) |
| `README.md` | This file — human overview |

## Input Methods

You choose how to feed context to Claude:

| Method | Best For |
|--------|----------|
| **Import documents** | Drop files into `context/import/` — business plans, pitch decks, Notion pages, strategy docs |
| **Chat interview** | Talk through your business conversationally — Claude asks questions, you answer |
| **Paste text** | Copy/paste from website, LinkedIn, strategy docs, memos |
| **ChatGPT memory import** | Export your ChatGPT memories and let Claude absorb months of accumulated context in seconds |

Mix and match — use all four if you want.

## Pro Tip

If you've been using ChatGPT, your fastest on-ramp is the memory export. Go to ChatGPT Settings > Personalization > Memory > Manage > Export. You'll get an email with a download link. Drop the JSON file into `context/import/` and Claude will categorize and absorb everything ChatGPT learned about you and your business. It's like transferring context from one AI to another.
