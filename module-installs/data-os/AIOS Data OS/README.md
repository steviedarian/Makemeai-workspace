# DataOS

> Pipe all your business data into one local database — fresh metrics every day, full picture every session.

## What This Does

- **Discovers your data sources** through an interactive workshop — Claude analyzes your business context and suggests what to connect
- **Builds custom collectors** for your specific tools (Stripe, YouTube, GA4, Google Sheets, Bitly, and more)
- **Creates a local SQLite database** with daily snapshots so you can track month-to-month trends
- **Generates a key-metrics file** your AI reads every session — it always knows the current state of your business
- **Runs daily on autopilot** — a cron job collects everything at 6 AM, so data is fresh when you start work

## What You Need

- A computer (Mac or Linux)
- Claude Code installed
- ContextOS module installed (or willingness to describe your business during setup)
- Accounts for whatever platforms you want to connect (Stripe, YouTube, Google Analytics, etc.)

## How to Install

1. Give this folder to Claude Code
2. Say: "Read INSTALL.md and help me set this up"
3. Follow along — Claude runs an interactive discovery workshop, then builds your custom pipeline

**Estimated setup time:** 30-60 minutes (depends on how many sources you connect)

## Running Cost

- **Database:** Free (SQLite on your machine, grows ~1MB per year of daily data)
- **API calls:** Free for most sources (YouTube, Stripe, GA4, Bitly all have free tiers)
- **Google service account:** Free (required for Sheets and GA4)
- **Total: $0/month** for typical usage

## What's Inside

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `INSTALL.md` | Interactive installation workshop (Claude reads this) |
| `scripts/db.py` | Database framework (init, connect, query helpers) |
| `scripts/config.py` | Environment variable loader |
| `scripts/collect.py` | Collection orchestrator (auto-discovers collectors) |
| `scripts/generate_metrics.py` | Key metrics generator (customized during setup) |
| `scripts/collect_fx_rates.py` | Starter collector (no auth needed — proves the pipeline) |
| `scripts/examples/*.py` | Reference collectors (YouTube, Stripe, GA4, Sheets, Bitly) |
| `scripts/.env.example` | API key template |
| `config/com.aios.data-collect.plist` | macOS daily scheduling template |
