"""
Daily Brief — Adaptive Mega-Prompt Builder

Assembles all available intelligence into a single prompt for Gemini:
- Business context (from ContextOS files)
- Funnel metrics (from DataOS database)
- Meeting transcripts (from IntelOS, if installed)
- Slack messages (from IntelOS, if installed)

The prompt adapts to what the user actually has — if they don't have
meetings or Slack, those sections are simply omitted.

RULES:
- Total output: approximately {word_budget} words
- Use the currency specified in the funnel metrics section
- Lead with the single most important signal — the one thing the owner needs to know first
- Compare metrics to 7-day averages — say "above/below average" with specific numbers
- If meeting transcripts are provided, extract key decisions, action items, and notable signals
- If Slack messages are provided, highlight important threads and decisions
- Write with conviction, not caution — this is a trusted advisor briefing, not a cautious report
- Use markdown headers (## for sections)
- Be specific: "$53K from 3 deals" not "good revenue day"
- If data is missing for a section, skip it entirely — do not write "No data available"
